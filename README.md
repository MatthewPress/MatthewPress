## Yo.  It's ya boy, Matt.

I'm studying Front-End Development at the Turing School of Software and Design. My current focus is on learning React and Express, but I'd also like to continue developing my CSS skills.

A far off goal I have is to make an application that can analyze an indoor rock climbing wall and with information about a climber the application can show the best route up the wall.
